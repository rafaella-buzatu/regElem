# regElem

Contains the code used in the Master Thesis 'Natural language strategies allow discovery of cell type-specific regulatory elements', by Rafaella Buzatu, master student of Bioinformatics and Biocomplexity at Utrecht University. <br>

The repository contains a script used to run <b>cisTopic</b> (1) - *cisTopic.R*, as well as a script to further analyise the topic assignments through gene-peak linkage and GSEA = *topicAnalysis.R*. The code to train and test a feed-forward neural network model that predicts the cell type is available in *DeppLearningTopics.R*. <br>

Unused script:
*DeppLearningCellTypes.R*: a script used to train a CNN to predict the relative cell type assignment based on the read count, with the following architecture:
